Data Cleaning Process.
1. I used control CTRL + H to check for missing values(N/A) and errors(#)  in all sheets.
"2. I selected the whole sheet, clicked on data, selected data cleanup and choose Remove duplicates."
This step was applied in all the sheets.
"3. I selected the whole sheet, clicked on data, selected data cleanup and choose Trim whitspace."
This step was applied in all the sheets.
4. Corrected data entry errors.
5. Fixed inconsistent text cases using =PROPER() for name categories and =UPPER() for binary categories like gender.
6. Standardized the date format to MM-DD-YY format.
